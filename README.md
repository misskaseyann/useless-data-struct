# Almost Useless Data Structure

This data structure will hold any type of object, through the use of a class template. The data structure operates as follows:
* The constructor takes no parameters.
* The data structure ensures all instance variables and the stored data is private.
* The data structure stores objects in an array
* The data structure initially has space for 100 items
* The data structure automatically resizes by 50% whenever a user inserts an item that puts it over the currently full value.
